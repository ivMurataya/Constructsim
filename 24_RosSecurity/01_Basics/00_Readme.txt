Have you been working with ROS? Have you launched files and created nodes, topics, or actions? 
Have you seen that you can freely access each topic, node, and parameter after launching it? 
It is user-friendly when you are learning, but could it be better when you have a robot in production?
The answer is no! Anyone with access to the same network and Data Distribution Service (DDS) domain 
where the robot is deployed will have the same opportunity as you to take control!

As you may know, ROS2 was designed for commercial projects. That means working in a safe environment.
How can ROS2 be executed in a trustee area without letting others access the same network?
The answer is here. ROS2 has been released with security tools that allow it to secure robotics systems. 
They are disabled by default, but they can be enabled to make robots safer.
This course will teach you how to work with the ROS2 security layer. You are going to learn how to enable security,
how to work with specific security packages, and also how to make a TurtleBot3 environment work in a safe layout.
