This unit is an introduction to the Understanding Kalman Filters course. 
You'll have a quick preview of the content you are going to cover during the course, and you will also view a practical demo.
  1.1   What's this course about?
    This course is about understanding the importance of Kalman Filters for robotics, and how they work.
    In this course, you will learn:
        What is a Kalman Filter and why are they required
        Different types of Kalman Filters and when to apply each one.
        Bayesian Filters
        One-dimensional Kalman Filters
        Multivariate Kalman Filters
        Unscented Kalman Filters
        Extended Kalman Filters
        Particle Filters
