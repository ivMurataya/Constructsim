Library Unit Tests
The first level of testing are the Library Unit Tests. In this level, 
we can test our code without worrying about the ROS-related stuff, 
such as ROS nodes, topics, publishers/subscribers, etc... 
This means that, in the end, these tests will be almost the same as a regular Python Unit Test.
