The last level of testing is the Integration Tests. In this level, we will start up multiple nodes and test that they all work together as expected. 
For instance, that your robot does what it's supposed to do. These tests are also done using a combination of a rostest with a unittest.

But in order to better understand this, let's go to practice! In the following Exercise, we are going to generate a simple integration test for the rotate robot service.
