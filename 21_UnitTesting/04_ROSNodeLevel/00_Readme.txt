ROS Unit Tests

The second level of testing is the ROS Node-Level Unit Tests. In this level, we are supposed to test the ROS-related stuff. 
For instance, if a ROS Publisher is working correctly (that is, if it's publishing the expected values into the expected topic), 
if a ROS Service is working correctly and it provides the expected response, etc...

But in order to better understand this, let's practice! In the following exercise, we are going to generate a simple test for the publish_once_in_cmd_vel() method of our Python Script.
