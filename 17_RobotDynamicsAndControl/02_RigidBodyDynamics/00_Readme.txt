In this Unit you will learn how to solve for the motion of rigid bodies in 3D space with the use of Newton's laws of motion. 
A rigid body is a distributed mass, i.e. a mass that has volume rather than being a single point in space.
For an ideal point mass, we use Newton's f=ma to formulate a mathematical dynamic model. 
With distributed masses, the main new feature is rotational dynamics. 

We'll explain the concepts of translational and rotational kinetic energies, and how to compute the moments of inertia of a rigid body. 
This basic knowledge will provide the foundations for the study of dynamics later in the course.
