Unit 3:   Dynamic Modeling
In this Unit you will learn how to model the dynamics of a simple robotic system and how to derive its equations of motion. 
Those equations relate the angles, velocities, and accelerations of the joints with the forces and torques applied to the system. 
Solving those equations allows us to compute the direct and inverse dynamics models. 
Closed-form solutions to the equations are generally not available, and computer integration of the differential equations needs to be used for a numerical solution.
