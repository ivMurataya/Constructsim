In this unit, we will create a full state feedback controller for allowing the robot to balance. Although control theory is out of the scope of this course, 
we will use a very common optimal control method to quickly create a controller for our system.
Subsections:
  Linearization
  Design of the controller
  Numerical integration of the continuous system
  Simulation of the robot-controller system in Gazebo
