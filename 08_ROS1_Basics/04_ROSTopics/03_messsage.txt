In order to create a new message, you will need to do the following steps:
Create a directory named 'msg' inside your package
Inside this directory, create a file named Name_of_your_message.msg (more information down)
Modify CMakeLists.txt file (more information down)
Modify package.xml file (more information down)
Compile
Use in code
1) Create a directory msg in your package.
roscd <package_name>
mkdir msg


2) The Age.msg file must contain this:
float32 years
float32 months
float32 days


3) In CMakeLists.txt
You will have to edit four functions inside CMakeLists.txt:
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
       rospy
       std_msgs
       message_generation   # Add message_generation here, after the other packages
)

add_message_files(
      FILES
      Age.msg
    ) # Dont Forget to UNCOMENT the parenthesis and add_message_files TOO

generate_messages(
      DEPENDENCIES
      std_msgs
) # Dont Forget to uncoment here TOO

catkin_package(
      CATKIN_DEPENDS rospy message_runtime   # This will NOT be the only thing here
)

4) Modify package.xml
<build_depend>message_generation</build_depend> 
<build_export_depend>message_runtime</build_export_depend>
<exec_depend>message_runtime</exec_depend>


To verify that your message has been created successfully, type in your Terminal rosmsg show Age. If the structure of the Age message appears, it will mean that your message has been created successfully and it's ready to be used in your ROS programs.
rosmsg show Age
