In this chapter, you are going to be introduced to the basic unit of calculus: a function. 
In mathematics, this unit provides valuable information on how a variable changes. 
It may change over time, position, or orientation, but it all can be studied with the properties of functions.
In this course, you will discover how to plot a function in Python, how to extract knowledge from this plot, 
how to calculate the derivative and the integral of a function, and also identify them seeing a graph. 
You'll also learn how to put meaning into the terms of an equation, the input variables and the 
output variables, the slope, the tangent line, the limit in a point, the local minima, 
the global minima, the area under a curve, etc.
