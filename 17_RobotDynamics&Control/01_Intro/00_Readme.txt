Unit 1:   Introduction
This unit presents the objectives of this course on dynamics for robot manipulators, and the learning methods and tools. The course will combine theoretical contents with demonstrations and exercises with models of simple yet realistic robots in a 3D simulator.
1.1   What will you learn?
To give you a glimpse of the course, please watch the following video
Robot dynamics is a step further into learning not only how the robots move (kinematics) but also why they move; that is, their behavior when forces and torques are applied to them.
The aim of this course is to give you an overview on how to model robotic systems and a first insight in how to use such models in order to control the systems.
