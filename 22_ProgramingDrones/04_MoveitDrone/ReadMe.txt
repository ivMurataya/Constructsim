MoveIt is a ROS framework that allows you to perform motion planning with a specific robot. And... what does this mean? 
Well, it basically means that it allows you to plan movements (motions) from point A to point B, without colliding with anything.
An important thing to mention is that MoveIt is, by default, prepared to work with Manipulation robots, and that's what it's usually used for. 
Therefore, we will have to take some extra steps in order to use it for our purpose, which is to plan trajectories for our drone. 
  But, you'll see this while you advance through the different sections of this chapter.
