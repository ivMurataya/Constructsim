In this unit, you will explore the kinematics of holonomic robots, which have the ability to move in any direction without constraints on their motion. 
Understanding the kinematic models of these robots is essential for developing precise control strategies in various robotic applications.
You will learn how to describe and analyze the motion of holonomic robots from two perspectives:
Motion with respect to the robot's frame
Motion with respect to the world's frame
By the end of this unit, you will have a solid grasp of holonomic robot kinematics, preparing you for advanced motion planning and control techniques.
