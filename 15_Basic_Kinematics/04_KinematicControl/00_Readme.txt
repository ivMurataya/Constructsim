In this unit, you will explore kinematic control techniques for mobile robots, focusing on how to guide a robot along a desired trajectory. 
You will learn about open-loop control, where commands are executed without sensor feedback, 
and feedback control, which continuously adjusts the robotâ€™s motion based on real-time data.
Mastering these control strategies is essential for achieving precise and reliable robot navigation, 
whether in structured environments or dynamic, real-world scenarios.
