Understanding the kinematics of nonholonomic mobile robots is essential for controlling their motion effectively. 
Unlike holonomic systems, these robots have constraints on their movement, meaning they cannot move freely in all directions.
In this chapter, you will explore the kinematic models of three common types of nonholonomic robots:
The Unicycle model, which serves as a foundation for many mobile robot designs.
The Differential Drive model, widely used in robotics due to its simple yet effective maneuverability.
The Car-Like model, which more closely resembles real-world vehicles and introduces steering constraints.
