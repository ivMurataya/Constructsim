Understanding how rigid bodies move in three-dimensional space is fundamental to robotics. 
In this unit, you will explore the essential concepts needed to represent the position and orientation of rigid bodies in 3D.
You will learn about frames of reference, how to represent positions and rotations, and how to apply rotational transformations. 
Additionally, you will study how rotations combine, different ways to parameterize them, and the use of homogeneous transformation matrices to describe motion in a unified way.
By the end of this unit, you will have a strong foundation in rigid-body motions, preparing you to analyze and control robot movement more effectively.
