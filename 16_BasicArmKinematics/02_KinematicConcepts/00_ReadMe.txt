Understanding the motion of robots begins with mastering fundamental kinematic concepts. 
In this chapter, you will explore the core principles that describe the position and orientation of rigid bodies in space.
You will learn about rigid bodies, position vectors, and rotation matrices, including why these matrices must be orthonormal. 
Additionally, you will study the composition of transformations and the homogeneous transformation matrix, which provides a unified way to represent position and orientation.
These concepts form the foundation for analyzing and controlling robotic motion, enabling precise and predictable movement in 3D space.
