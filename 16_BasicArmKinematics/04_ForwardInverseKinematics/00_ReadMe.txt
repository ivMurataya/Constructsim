In this chapter, you will dive into the essential concepts of forward kinematics and inverse kinematics, which are fundamental for controlling robotic manipulators.
    Forward Kinematics focuses on determining the position and orientation of the end-effector based on the given joint values.
    Inverse Kinematics involves computing the required joint values to achieve a desired end-effector position and orientation.
Understanding these concepts is crucial for designing and programming robotic arms to perform precise and efficient movements. 
Through this unit, you will learn how to apply both forward and inverse kinematics to robotic manipulators, setting the stage for more advanced motion planning techniques.
