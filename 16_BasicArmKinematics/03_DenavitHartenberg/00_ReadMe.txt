In this chapter, you will learn how to calculate the forward kinematics of a robotic manipulator using the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters. 
Understanding forward kinematics is essential for determining the position and orientation of a robot’s end-effector based on its joint values.
We begin by exploring kinematic chains, which consist of multiple rigid bodies connected by joints. 
These chains form the foundation of robotic motion and can be analyzed using different approaches:

    Geometric methods: Use only geometry to determine the relationships between all joint values in a kinematic chain. 
                        This method is suitable for simple kinematic chains but becomes increasingly complex as the system grows.
    Algebraic solutions: One of the most commonly used methods, which we will focus on in this course.
    Numerical solutions: A brute-force approach that tests all possible joint values to find the desired results.

This chapter focuses on the algebraic method, where we define the kinematic diagram and establish the relationships between each link’s frames using the DH convention. 
Mastering this process is crucial for developing accurate kinematic models and preparing for more advanced topics like inverse kinematics and motion control.
