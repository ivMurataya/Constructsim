We as humans are used to manipulate objects all the time.
For us, this is a natural thing and, most of the time, we do it without even thinking about it. 
However, when we want to imitate this behavior using robots, this process gets much more complicated.

Within this course you will study the kienmatics of robot arms, also known as manipulators. 
And by kinematics I mean the study of the motion of a kinematic chain, focusing on forward and inverse kinematics.

The aim of the course is to provide you with the concepts and tools for being able to understand how the kinematics of a robot arm works.
This is the cornerstone of robot manipulation, as it can be later expanded with the addition of external sensors in other courses. 
It is also very usefull for robot leg locomotion for quadrupeds and bipeds.
