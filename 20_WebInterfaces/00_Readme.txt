What's this course about?
The increasing use of robots and the adoption of ROS motivated the creation of this course. 
Every company that builds a robot, creates a solution for existing robots, or even uses a commercial one for its own purposes, needs an interface to operate it.
Due to this necessity, we decided to push on "how to develop interfaces for ROS." In fact, there are many (many!) different ways to do that. 
You can just provide a custom RViz template for your solution. Or, if you can spend a bit more time, get the closest solution for ROS GUI, 
for example, using the well-known RQT library to build interfaces as ROS packages. Further, you can develop your own application 
that connects to a ROS Core network and do it the way you prefer (desktop apps, Android/iOS apps, etc.).
Which is the best one?
  I can't answer this question! It depends on:
  Who are you developing for?
  Which OS does it have to work on?
  Which resources do you have available to develop/maintain the app?
So.. how do we deal with that?
A generic, highly customizable, well-known and powerful solution!
