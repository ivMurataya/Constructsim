ROS 2 provides a powerful set of pre-built controllers and broadcasters within the ros2_controllers repository, 
enabling developers to quickly set up control pipelines for robotic systems. 
These tools allow seamless integration with various sensors and actuators, making it easier to 
implement position, velocity, and effort-based control without starting from scratch.

In this unit, we will focus on the different types of controllers available in ros2_control, how they function, 
and how you can use them to command your robot efficiently. While broadcasters—responsible for publishing sensor 
data—are an important part of ros2_control, they are not covered in this unit.

Before diving in, ensure you are familiar with setting up ros2_control, as discussed in Unit 2. 
Now, let's explore how to leverage these pre-built controllers to enhance your robotic applications!
