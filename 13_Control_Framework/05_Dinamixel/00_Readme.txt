In this unit, you will learn how to implement a hardware interface specifically for Dynamixel servos using the ros2_control framework. 
Dynamixel servos are intelligent actuators widely used in robotics due to their built-in controllers, networking capabilities, and precise position control. 
They communicate using protocols that allow for efficient multi-servo coordination, making them ideal for robotic applications.
By the end of this unit, you will understand how to create a dedicated hardware interface package, configure it for Dynamixel communication protocols, and integrate it into a ROS 2 system for efficient motor control
