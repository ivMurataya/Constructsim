The first thing you'll need to do is to download the provided ROS2 packages that have already been written for you into your ros2_ws workspace.
Go to the ros2_ws directory, and then into src and download the repository:
cd ~/ros2_ws/src

git clone https://bitbucket.org/theconstructcore/ros2_control_course.git
