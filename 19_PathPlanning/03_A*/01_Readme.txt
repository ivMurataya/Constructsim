Welcome to Unit 3!
In this unit, you'll explore the A* (pronounced A-star) search algorithmâ€”one of the most widely used and efficient algorithms in robotic path planning.
ðŸš€ What Youâ€™ll Learn:
    The difference between informed and uninformed search strategies
    What heuristics are and how they help speed up path planning
    The basics of Greedy Best-First Search
    How the A* search algorithm combines heuristics with cost
    How to write and test your own A* implementation through simulation
