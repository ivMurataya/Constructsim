This final unit serves both as a wrap-up and an exciting extension of what you’ve learned throughout the course. 
You’ll revisit core path planning concepts—especially Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm—and apply them in a new context: a robot constrained by a real-world road network.
In the first part of the project, you'll set up the open_street_map ROS packages so you can load and work with actual OpenStreetMap data in ROS.
In the second part, you’ll take on a hands-on challenge: we’ve intentionally removed a key portion of the path planning code from one of the OpenStreetMap ROS packages.
Your task? Rebuild the missing logic to restore and enhance its path planning capabilities.
But how different is path planning on roadmaps compared to the environments you've worked with so far? That’s what this project will help you explore. 
Spoiler: the core ideas remain the same, and if you’ve been following along, this challenge will feel like second nature. 
Plus, we’ve got your back—the rest of the codebase handles the pre- and post-processing, so you can focus purely on crafting the algorithm.
So, without further ado, let’s dive into your final challenge!
