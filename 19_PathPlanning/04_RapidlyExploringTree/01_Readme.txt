Welcome to Unit 4! In this unit, you'll dive into Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT)—a powerful algorithm designed to tackle complex path planning problems, especially in large or high-dimensional spaces.

📌 What You’ll Learn:
The core ideas behind sampling-based path planning methods
How RRT works and why it’s a game-changer for high-DOF systems
The main properties and advantages of RRT
How to implement RRT in Python
How to integrate your solution with the ROS Navigation Stack
When and why to prefer RRT over traditional grid-based approaches like A*

🌍 Why RRT?
While algorithms like A* are fantastic for simple, 2D environments, they tend to struggle as map size or robot complexity increases. As you add more dimensions—like joint angles of a robotic arm or navigating a drone in 3D space—the performance of grid-based planners quickly drops off.
That’s where probabilistic planners come in.
Unlike Dijkstra or A*, which systematically explore a map, RRT takes a radically different approach: it samples random points in the space and connects them in a way that rapidly expands the search toward the goal—without needing to examine every grid cell.
RRT is one of the most efficient and popular tools for path planning in high-resolution and high-dimensional environments, and it’s used in everything from robotic arms to autonomous cars.

By the end of this unit, you’ll have a solid grasp of how RRT works and how to apply it in real-world robotics applications. You’ll even have a working simulation where your robot navigates through a complex environment full of obstacles—completely autonomously.
