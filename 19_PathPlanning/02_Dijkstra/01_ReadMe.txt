Welcome to Unit 2!
In this unit, we dive into one of the most iconic algorithms in computer science and robotics: Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm.
Youâ€™ll explore how this algorithm, rooted in graph theory, can be used to plan safe and efficient paths for a mobile robot navigating through a complex environment. 
You'll not only learn the theory but also implement it from scratch in Python and integrate it with ROS.
    ðŸ§  What You'll Learn:
    The basics of graph theory and how it applies to robotic maps
    A step-by-step breakdown of how Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm works
    How to code the algorithm yourself in Python
    How to test your implementation on real map data using ROS
By the end of this unit, your Dijkstra-based planner will guide a mobile robot through a simulated indoor environment, avoiding obstacles and reaching its goal. 
Even cooler? Youâ€™ll be overriding the default ROS Navigation Stackâ€™s plannerâ€”meaning your code could be used on a real robot!
