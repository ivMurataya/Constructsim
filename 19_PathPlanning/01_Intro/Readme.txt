Welcome to the course!
In this unit, youâ€™ll get an overview of what to expect in Introduction to Mobile Robot Path Planning. 
You'll preview the core topics covered throughout the course and even see some of the code you'll develop in action.
Surely you've asked yourself many times: Whatâ€™s the best way to get to a place Iâ€™ve never been before?
Thatâ€™s exactly the kind of problem that navigation apps solve for us every dayâ€”and they do so using path planning algorithms.
These algorithms are not just limited to GPS apps. Theyâ€™re used in a wide range of fields including:
  ðŸ“¡ Computer networking
  ðŸ“Š Business analytics
  ðŸŽ® Video games
  ðŸ§¬ Genetic sequencing
  ðŸ¤– And of courseâ€”robotics
In robotics, path planning is a fundamental component in solving the larger challenge of autonomous robot navigation. 
And thatâ€™s exactly what youâ€™ll be learning how to do in this course!
