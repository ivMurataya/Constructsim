"""
First of all, we are going to create a new package named robot_control.
catkin_create_pkg robot_control rospy

The next step will be to create another folder, inside the src folder, 
named robot_control (yes, it has the same name as the original package).
Now, inside this 2nd robot_control folder (robot_control/src/robot_control)


The first thing we will do is to create an empty file, The __init__.py file makes Python treat directories containing it as modules.
This will make it much more easier for us to import this file later in our test scripts.

The second step will be to create a new file, named setup.py
