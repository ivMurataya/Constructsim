"""


In the constructor of the class, initialize a ROS2 node named my_action_server. Also, and very important, create an ActionServer object to which you pass four arguments:

    The ROS2 node that contains the Action Client: in this case, self.
    The type of Action: GoToPose.
    The Action name: go_to_pose
    A callback method to be executed when the Action receives a goal: self.execute_callback.

    Then we create a publisher to the /initialpose topic, which is crucial for accurate navigation.

    We set up an ActionClient for the NavigateToPose action provided by the Nav2 package.

    Before sending any navigation goals, we ensure that the localization system is active by calling: self.wait_for_localization()

    Finally, we set the robot's starting position and orientation by calling: self.set_initial_pose(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
