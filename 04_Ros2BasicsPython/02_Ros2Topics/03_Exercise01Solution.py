"""
Write a Publisher and Subscriber node:

    Create a new package and call it exercise31_pkg with rclpy, std_msgs, sensor_msgs, and geometry_msgs as dependencies.
    Use the previous publisher code as a template to create a new program that makes the robot turn left using Twist messages.
    Get information from the laser and use the LaserScan messages to decide how to move.
        Turn left until you get a value lower than 5m (from the laser direction in front of the robot). Then, move straight.
        If the distance received is greater than 50cm, move in a straight line towards the wall (do not go too fast!).
        If the distance received is less than 50cm, the robot stops.
